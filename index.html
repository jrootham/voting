<h1>Map Voting Data to StatsCan Data</h1>
<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>
    Create a geospatial database mapping StatsCan data to poll level voting
    data.  This is slightly more complex than might be obvious because
    in Canada the census data uses a conic projection and voting data uses
    Mercator (at lest mostly), so there is projection conversion involved.
    However, there do appear to be available tools for this problem.
</p>
<p>
    Extending this to other jurisdictions and adding polling data as
    elections happen will be a long term project.
</p>
<h2>Applications</h2>
<h3>Redistricting</h3>
<p>
An app to allow experimenting with different district boundaries.
</p>
<p>
    This will be the primary application using the database.
</p>

<p>
    This will start with City of Toronto voting data since there is a
    redistricting process going on now and there is at least the possibility
    of a multi member version happening when the Province passes new
    municipal electoral legislation.
</p>
<p>
    The priority list for extending to other jurisdictions will depend
    on redistricting actions.
</p>
<h3>Campaign Models</h3>
<p>
An app to model campaigns, especially multi-member district campaigns.  This is
not of as great significance, however, it will be of great use in campaigns
    for Proportional Representation.
</p>
<h3>Local Projection</h3>
<p>
    An app for projections of local campaigns, designed for reporters.
    This would be a model that used national (or provincial) demographic
    polling data and uses that in combination of the local demographics
    and voting history to project local results.
